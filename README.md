# Alfred-workflow-Firefox-basic-Google-search
Use Firefox to search Google excluding AI results with option to use verbatim search

# Introduction

The purpose of this workflow is to allow a search of Google which excludes from the results Google AI generated results. In the workflow configuration you can also choose whether or not to exclude from the search Amazon, eBay and/or YouTube.

You can optionally specify a verbatim search (which makes Google use your exact search inputs instead of fuzzy searching everything).

The search results will open in a Firefox private window.

# Usage

Select in the configuration which Google domain you wish to use for your searches (the default is https://google.com but https://google.co.uk is provided as an alternative). Choose which listed domains (if any) you wish to exclude from the search.

Type the keyword (the default is `goo`) followed by a space and your search term then press <kbd>⏎</kbd>.

The search results open in a new Firefox private tab.

For a verbatim search press <kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>⏎</kbd> after your search term.
